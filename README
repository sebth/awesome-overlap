This is a layout for the window manager `awesome'.  This layout arranges
windows similar to the `tile' layout, the difference being that windows
residing in the same column are overlapped instead of stacked.

This layout has only been tested with awesome 3.4.


How to install
--------------

First

	cp overlap.lua "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-~/.config}"/awesome

then add the following to the top of your `rc.lua'

	local overlap = require "overlap"

and add `overlap', `overlap.left', `overlap.bottom' and `overlap.top' to the
`layouts' array.

To make the layout icons visible

	cp -R icons "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-~/.config}"/awesome

and add the following to your `theme.lua'

	theme.layout_overlap = awful.util.getdir("config") ..
	                       "/icons/overlapw.png"
	theme.layout_overlapleft = awful.util.getdir("config") ..
	                           "/icons/overlapleftw.png"
	theme.layout_overlapbottom = awful.util.getdir("config") ..
	                             "/icons/overlapbottomw.png"
	theme.layout_overlaptop = awful.util.getdir("config") ..
	                          "/icons/overlaptopw.png"

If you want black icons, remove the `w' from the icon filenames.
